## Thoughts on the 2024 US Elections
<i>Humanitarian Funding Needs Transcend Party Politics</i><br>
ScripNYC unlocks vast pools of latent capital which may be applied to a diverse range of unmet needs. It is our hope that ScripNYC grants all stakeholders sufficient cognitive, political, and operational leeway so they may negotiate "have your cake and eat it too" compromises that respect the wishes of New Yorkers while protecting all constitutional and human rights.

## Some Notes on Scrip Adoption

<i>Non-Revenue Penalty Fees and Multipliers</i><br>
To increase adoption, New York City agencies may choose to accept ScripNYC to satisfy non- payment or late fees attached to uncollected fines. This may be further incentivized with a multiplier; for instance: “scrip may be redeemed for 1.3x its nominal value when applied to late fees.” This approach motivates the settlement of unpaid fines without further burdening the court system. The City may additionally increase adoption by accepting scrip-only payments for temporary quality-of-life improvement measures, such as fines for excessive vehicle idling or littering, or in instances where a typical dollar-denominated fine would likely improve subjective well-being but may be an undue burden for the offender.
